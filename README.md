## A High-Performance, Secure, and Decentralized C++ Transformer

This project is a pure C++ implementation of a decoder-only transformer model designed for fully decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed training. It was built from the ground up to be secure, resilient, and efficient, capable of operating in a trustless environment without any central coordinator.

It incorporates a multi-phase security and optimization strategy, transforming it from a powerful prototype into a production-ready foundation for decentralized AI. This includes:
- **A Hardened Network Core:** All communication is encrypted with TLS and authenticated with cryptographic signatures. Peer discovery is decentralized through a Peer Exchange (PEX) protocol, removing single points of failure.
- **Real-World Performance Optimizations:** The system uses gradient quantization to dramatically reduce bandwidth and asynchronous communication to maximize GPU utilization, making training feasible over the public internet.
- **True Resilience:** A Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) two-phase commit consensus mechanism ensures the integrity of the model, while a robust state synchronization protocol allows new nodes to securely join and get up-to-date at any time.

# A decoder-style Transformer in C++

A pure C++ implementation of a decoder-only transformer model with CUDA support. It is based on the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al and has been trained on an example dataset found in the `data` directory called 'training_pairs.txt'. It performs a single token prediction for each input.

## Transformer Implementation Features

## Core Attention Mechanisms

- Standard Multi-Head Attention
- Grouped Query Attention (GQA)
- Flash Attention optimization
- Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)
- Sliding Window Attention
- Key-Value Cache support

## Architecture Components

- Layer Normalization
- Feed Forward Networks
- Dropout layers
- Residual connections
- Language Model Head
- Tokenizer with vocabulary management

## Architectural Upgrades

- **Mixture of Experts (MoE):** The model now supports a sparse MoE architecture, allowing for a massive increase in parameter count with a relatively small increase in computational cost during inference. The MoE layer is fully configurable (number of experts, top-k routing) and includes an auxiliary load-balancing loss to ensure stable training.
- **SwiGLU Activation:** The traditional ReLU activation in the feed-forward networks has been replaced with the modern and more performant SwiGLU activation function, aligning the architecture with state-of-the-art models like Llama 3.

## Training Features

- Batch processing
- Beam Search
- Dynamic learning rate adjustment
- Gradient clipping
- Loss computation and backpropagation
- Training/Evaluation modes
- Gradient checkpointing
- Performance metrics tracking

## Optimization Features

- CUDA support for GPU acceleration
- OpenMP parallelisation
- Half-precision (FP16) support
- Memory pooling
- Gradient accumulation
- SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization) optimizer

### Custom CUDA Kernels
- **Optimized SwiGLU Kernel:** A dedicated CUDA kernel has been implemented for the SwiGLU activation function, significantly accelerating the forward and backward passes of the feed-forward layers.
- **Optimized MoE Router Kernel:** A high-performance CUDA kernel handles the MoE's top-k gating mechanism, efficiently routing tokens to the correct experts on the GPU.

## Distributed Training

This project supports two distinct modes for distributed training, allowing you to scale from a single multi-GPU machine to a global network of peers.

### 1. Traditional Distributed Training (MPI/NCCL)

This mode is designed for high-performance, data-parallel training in a traditional cluster environment (e.g., a multi-node HPC system or a cloud-based GPU cluster). It uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for inter-node communication and can leverage NVIDIA's NCCL for highly optimized GPU-to-GPU communication.

#### Features
- **Data Parallel Training**: Automatically splits data batches across all available MPI ranks.
- **Gradient Synchronization**: Uses an efficient AllReduce operation to average gradients across all processes after each backward pass.
- **Optimized GPU Communication**: Leverages NCCL for high-bandwidth, low-latency communication directly between GPUs.
- **Zero-Dependency Building**: If MPI/NCCL are not found on the system, the build system creates lightweight stubs, allowing the code to compile and run in a single-node mode without any changes.

#### Quick Start

To build with MPI/NCCL support and run the example:
```bash
# Build with system MPI/NCCL (if available)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make distributed_training_example -j$(nproc)

# Run on a single node (uses stubs if MPI is not installed)
./distributed_training_example

# Run on a single node with 4 processes (e.g., 4 GPUs)
mpirun -np 4 ./distributed_training_example

# Run on multiple nodes using a hostfile
mpirun -np 8 -hostfile hosts.txt ./distributed_training_example
```
For detailed build options, performance tuning (e.g., for InfiniBand/Ethernet), and debugging, please refer to the comprehensive example in `examples/distributed_training_example.cpp`.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Distributed Training

This mode enables fully decentralized, coordinator-less training across a network of peers, which can be geographically distributed. It is designed for Byzantine fault tolerance, making it resilient to unreliable nodes or even malicious actors.

#### Key Features
- **Fully Decentralized**: No central server or single point of failure. Peer discovery is managed by a robust Peer Exchange (PEX) protocol.
- **Secure Communication**: All peer-to-peer traffic is encrypted using TLS.
- **Authenticated Messaging**: Every message is digitally signed with a node's unique private key and verified, guaranteeing authenticity and integrity.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerant**: A two-phase (Prepare/Commit) BFT consensus mechanism protects the model's integrity from malicious nodes and network splits.
- **Efficient & Asynchronous**: Maximizes GPU utilization by decoupling network consensus from local computation. Gradient quantization reduces network bandwidth by ~75%.
- **Dynamic & Resilient**: Nodes can join and leave the network at any time. New nodes can securely synchronize with the current model state from their peers.
- **10X Performance**: The native C++/CUDA implementation offers a significant performance advantage over standard frameworks.

#### Quick Start

To build and run the P2P example:
```bash
# Build P2P components
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_P2P=ON
make p2p_training_example -j$(nproc)

# Start the first (bootstrap) node
./p2p_training_example --port 8888

# Connect other nodes to the network
./p2p_training_example --port 8889 --bootstrap 127.0.0.1:8888
```
The P2P example provides an interactive command line for managing the network and initiating training.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several external libraries. The build system is configured to handle them in different ways.

### Core Dependencies

These are required to build the full feature set of the application.

- **C++20 Compiler:** A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2019+).
- **CMake (3.15+):** For building the project.
- **OpenSSL:** Required for secure P2P communication (TLS and message signing). Must be installed on the system.
- **nlohmann/json:** Used for parsing JSON configuration files. This library is downloaded automatically by CMake using `FetchContent`, so no manual installation is needed.

### Optional Dependencies (for Advanced Features)

These dependencies enable specific high-performance features. The project will still compile and run without them, but with reduced functionality.

- **CUDA Toolkit (11.0+):** Enables massive performance acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs. If not found, the project will be built for CPU only.
- **OpenMP:** Enables parallel processing on the CPU, improving performance for CPU-only builds. Most modern compilers include this.
- **MPI (e.g., OpenMPI, MPICH):** Enables traditional multi-node distributed training in a cluster environment. If not found, a stub is created to allow single-node development.
- **NCCL (2.7+):** Enables high-performance, direct GPU-to-GPU communication for multi-GPU distributed training. Requires CUDA. If not found, a stub is created.


## Building

To build the project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Training the model

After building the project, running `main.cpp` will train the model and save the model hyperparamters to whatever directory is specified in the `config/transformer_config.json` file. To execute the training on the sample dataset, run the following command
from the build directory:

```bash
./transformer
```

## Logging

The logging is done to a file called `transformer.log` in the `build` directory.

## Configuration

The configuration is done in the `config/transformer_config.json` file.

## Limitations

- The model training is performed on a very small dataset, so its predictions are certainly sub-optimal, given its constraints.
- It only works on a format that follows the training data i.e I like to cook in the |kitchen (where `|` is the delimiter).
